wasmCloud is a suite of tools and libraries that can be used in a number of different use cases and patterns. The first
thing you will want to install is the **wasmCloud core**, which includes the default host runtime binary and the wasmCloud shell (`wash`) CLI.

If you plan on building capability providers or working within the Rust ecosystem, we highly recommend that you [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) in addition to the core.
