Creating an actor with **wasmCloud** is simple and easy. Today, we support actors created in **Rust** but we will soon have support for other languages as those languages develop better tooling and support for WebAssembly.

To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have the wasmCloud host runtime installed as well as the `wash` CLI, and have a Rust installation with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target available.

This guide will walk you through the following steps to creating an actor:

* [Generate the Scaffold](./scaffold)
* [Define Message Handlers](./handlers)
* [Run the Actor](./run)
