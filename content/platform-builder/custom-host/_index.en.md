wasmCloud includes the default, OTP-based host runtime. We also have a JavaScript-based host runtime. However, there's nothing preventing anyone from making other specialized applications that can act as a wasmCloud host.

So long as a number of specifications and requirements are met, anyone can build a wasmCloud host that participates meaningfully within a lattice network.
